# Ultimate Gaming Quiz

My site is created with the intention of delivering an entertaining source of media to users. I have done this by creating an interactive quiz about video games that will challenge users. I designed the site with an old school arcade scheme in mind, this plays on the nostalgia that users would have around video games. Any user that goes on the site will be able to easily interact with all the sites functions. IF CAN BE DONE Users will also be able to store a personal highscore to encourage sharing with friends and attempting to beat each other. This will in turn create a social aspect around the quiz.

## UX

The colour scheme of the site uses a slightly light black and bright yellow. This ensures that all the text and content of the site stands out and can easily be read. The bright yellow is based on old arcade style colour schemes, almost throwing back to games like Pacman. This is intentionally designed this way to play into the video game aspect of the quiz while maintaining a positive contrast score. Some other elements such as the play button and the actual quiz options use a bright blue and white/yellow scheme. The blue also plays into the arcadey feel of the site and again ensures that all the content can be read by all users.
